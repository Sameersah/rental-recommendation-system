Request Tracing: Tracks the flow of requests through different services to provide a comprehensive view of the system's operation.
Performance Data Collection: Collects data on the performance of various services, including response times and error rates.
Bottleneck Identification: Analyzes the collected data to identify performance bottlenecks and potential issues.
