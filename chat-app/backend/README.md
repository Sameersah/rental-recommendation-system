# Chat-App Backend Service

## Introduction
The **Chat-App Backend Service** is a core component of the Chat-App project, responsible for handling user interactions and providing property recommendations. It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to fetch relevant property details and uses prompt engineering to generate accurate responses.

---

## How It Works
The backend service uses a combination of retrieval-based and generation-based methods to enhance the performance of the language model. Key functionalities include:

- **Fetching Property Details**: Retrieves property details from a Redis cache or an external API.
- **Combining Context and User Prompt**: Merges the retrieved property details with the user's prompt to create a comprehensive input for the language model.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Designs and structures prompts to guide the language model's output effectively.
- **Model Pipeline**: Uses the `transformers` library to load a pre-trained language model and generate responses based on the structured prompt.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Redis server
- Docker (for containerization)
- Jenkins (for CI/CD)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
   cd chat-app/backend

Install dependencies:  
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Redis: Ensure that a Redis server is running and accessible. Update the Redis host and port in the chatbot.py file if necessary.  
Run the application:  
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

pytest test_app.py test_chatbot.py
